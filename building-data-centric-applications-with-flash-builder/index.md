# Building data-centric applications with Flash Builder

Flash Builder tools can assist you in creating applications that access data
services. You start by creating a Flex project for your applications. You can
then connect to a data service, configure the access of data from the service,
and build a user interface for an application. In some cases, you first create
the user interface and then access the data service.
